<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://bryght7.github.io/beuste/)

This small side-project started when a friend, who writes contracts at his work, needed a tool to quickly write numbers in letters.

Even though there are dozens of existing solutions out there (even within the Google search bar), I decided to give it a go as an exercise to figure out the algorithm.

### Features

- Converts the input number on the fly
- Two spelling methods : traditional and monetary
- Supports decimal numbers
- Copy result to clipboard
- Dark mode

### Built With

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
  > I tried Vue.js for the first time to easily add dynamism and reactivity to my page. I got to admit I really liked how it allowed me to do everything I wanted by simply including Vue in my script. Though I didn't feel like diving into Vue CLI yet. I might explore it more in a bigger project.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  > I tried Tailwind CSS for the first time as well. I enjoyed how quickly I could create my UI without having to define my own styles. Definitely will use again in small test apps. However, I can foresee how it could become a huge mess in a bigger project (the amount of classes in my template is already triggering me a little...)
